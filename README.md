# caMicroscope distribution


run with `docker-compose -f caMicroscope.yml up`

this will build all services and run in the foreground.
Use `docker-compose -f caMicroscope.yml build` to rebuild the services.

Once everything is up, go to <the host this is running on>:4010/ to see the landing page.

## SSL
To enable ssl, mount the private key and certificate files to the ca-back service in /root/src/ssl/privatekey.pem and /root/src/ssl/certificate.pem respectively. HTTPS mode will only be enabled if both of these files are present.

## Component Services
mongo - vanilla mongo container

idxMongo - ephemeral container to index mongo (that is, this container is *expected* to exit once it's done its job)

iip - slide tile server (see https://github.com/camicroscope/iipImage)

loader - extracts metadata needed for image loading (see https://github.com/camicroscope/SlideLoader)

back - security, data, and routing (see https://github.com/camicroscope/caracal)

back/viewer - within back, viewer files ( see https://github.com/camicroscope/caMicroscope)

## Configuration
Logging - Container Logging is, for HIPAA reasons, disabled. Feel free to use a different logging engine if desired, especially for development.

See backend and security config notes [here](https://github.com/camicroscope/caracal).

Image Volume - This is, by default, the images directory in this directory. If this is changed, please make the same change across all impacted services.

## Securing caMicroscope

### Getting an Identity Provider and Setting up Login

When selecting, an identity provider, note that we expect it to provide a JWT, and to have a certificate/public key/secret which can be used to verify such JWTs.

The example given in the Distro within config/login.html is set up to use google as an identity provider. See [this guide from google](https://developers.google.com/identity/sign-in/web/sign-in) to set up your own project, which is necessary to enable login on your instance.

### Adding Users to caMicroscope

Add users as in ./config/add\_users.js. This can be done either by editing this file before bringing up the stack, or by running similar code against the camic database in ca-mongo. Attributes can be added to deny access to routes (e.g. allow only some users to post and delete) and userFilters can be used to change visibility of particular documents.

The email field is the email field (or failing that, sub field) in that priority from the identity provider.

## PathDB

To use PathDB, use quip-pathdb.yml instead of caMicroscope.yml.

Running QuIP with PathDB (https://github.com/SBU-BMI/PathDB):

0) place yourself in quip\_distro folder.<br>
1) copy config/httpd.conf.template to config/httpd.conf<br>
2) configure httpd.conf with your certificates to enable https.<br>
3) build with, "docker-compose -f quip-pathdb.yml build"<br>
4) run with, "docker-compose -f quip-pathdb.yml up -d"

## Support
Feel free to add any support inquiry as a github issue to this repository. Other feedback can be given via [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScL91LxrpAZjU88GBZP9gmcdgdf8__uNUwhws2lzU6Lr4qNwA/viewform).

## System Recommendations
As of 3.8.0, the non-pathdb caMicroscope deployment seems to peak about 500mb of memory per user from basic tests. The system is most likely to work optimally if the CPU can support two or three threads per concurrent user. The containers themselves take up a total of about 6gb of disk, but note that whole slide images typically use 0.5-2 gb of disk each.
